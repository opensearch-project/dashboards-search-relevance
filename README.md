## Search Relevance Tools

### Summary
In search applications, tuning relevance is a constant, iterative exercise to bring the right search results to your end users. The tooling in this repository aims to help the search relevance engineer and business user create the best search experience possible for application users without hiding internals from engineers who want to go deep into the details.

## Projects
# Search Comparison UI - the first release in this plugin will include an experimental feature to allow users to enter a plain text search query, substitute that query into two different QueryDSLs and compare the results side by side.
